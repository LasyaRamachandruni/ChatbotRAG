Help Us Bring Finals Week to Life – Just 4 Hours Can Make a Big Impact

Dear [[FirstName|Colleague]],

As we head into our fourth year of Finals Week events, I want to take a moment to reflect and say thank you. Your support and participation last semester truly helped create something special for our students—and it didn't go unnoticed.

Looking back at Spring 2025, what stood out most were the moments of joy in the middle of a stressful week. From students crafting their ultimate hot chocolate masterpieces, to stumbling into an unexpected but much-needed last-minute tutoring session, giveaways, to simply finding a space to breathe, laugh, and connect—your contributions helped make that happen.

Those nights were filled with student smiles, shared snacks, games, quiet study corners, and spontaneous conversations. In what is often one of the hardest weeks of the semester, you helped bring a little light—and for that, we're so grateful.

This year, we're continuing the tradition for each semester in the King Library. The library is one of the few places where students naturally mix beyond their departments, and that blend creates something special: a chance to meet someone they might never encounter in their program, build friendships that last beyond finals week, or even discover new perspectives that could reshape their academic journey.

Here's all we're asking:
Just 4 hours over 2 evenings each semester
Fall 2025: Dec 9–10 (7–10 PM)
Spring 2026: May 12–13 (7–10 PM)

One thing we hear time and again from our students is that SJSU can feel fragmented—like there's no single place where everyone truly belongs. But just imagine what could happen if we all showed up, for just two 4-hour evenings, and created that space together. A space where students, regardless of major or background, feel seen, supported, and cared for—especially during one of the most stressful times of the year.

Whether it's an activity, a donation (snacks, funds, giveaways), or helping hands—we'd love for you to join us in any way that works for you. Imagine what's possible if we all showed up. Let's make Finals Week a little brighter for every SJSU student.

Reach out to Lisa.josefik@sjsu.edu or fill out RSVP Google Form to sign up NOW.

Thank you for considering. We can't wait to see what we build together this year.

Best regards,
